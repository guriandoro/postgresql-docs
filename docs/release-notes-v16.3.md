This release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is based on [PostgreSQL 16.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16-3.html). 

## Release Highlights

* Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL now includes the etcd distributed configuration store version 3.5.x for all supported operating systems. This enhancement simplifies deploying high-availability solutions because you can install all necessary components from a single source, ensuring their seamless compatibility.
* Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is now available on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat.
* Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and compatible derivatives is now fully compatible with upstream `llvm` packages and includes the latest version 16.0.6 of them. 

    To ensure a smooth upgrade process, the recommended approach is to  **upgrade to the latest minor version within your current major version before going to the next major version**. For example, if you're currently on 15.6, upgrade to 15.7 first, then you can upgrade to 16.3. This two-step approach avoids any potential conflicts caused by differing `llvm` versions on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and compatible derivatives.
