This release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is based on [PostgreSQL 16.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16-6.html). 

## Release Highlights

* This release includes fixes for [CVE-2024-10978](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-10978/) and for certain PostgreSQL extensions that break because they depend on the modified Application Binary Interface (ABI). These regressions were introduced in PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21. For this reason, the release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 16.5 has been skipped. 

* Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL includes [`pgvector` :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) - an open source extension that enables you to use PostgreSQL as a vector database. It brings vector data type and vector operations (mainly similarity search) to PosgreSQL. You can install `pgvector` from repositories, tarballs, and it is also available as a Docker image. 

*  Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL now statically links `llvmjit.so` library for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 and compatible derivatives. This resolves the conflict between the LLVM version required by Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL and the one supplied with the operating system. This also enables you to use the LLVM modules supplied with the operating system for other software you require.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 and compatible derivatives, Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL also includes the following packages:

* `llvm` 17.0.6 packages. This fixes compatibility issues with LLVM from upstream.
* supplemental `python3-etcd` 0.4.5 packages, which can be used for setting up Patroni clusters. 
                                                      
Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is also shipped with the [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq.html) library. It contains "a set of
library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL
backend server and to receive the results of these queries."
