# Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 17.2.1 ({{date.17_2}})

--8<-- "release-notes-intro.md"

This release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is based on Percona Server for PostgreSQL 17.2.1 - a binary compatible, open source drop in replacement of [PostgreSQL Community 17.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17-2.html). 

## Release Highlights

* This release includes fixes for [CVE-2024-10978](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-10978/) and for certain PostgreSQL extensions that break because they depend on the modified Application Binary Interface (ABI). These regressions were introduced in PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21. For this reason, the release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 17.1.1 has been skipped. 
* Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL includes [`pgvector` :octicons-link-external-16](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) - an open source vector similarity search for Postgres. You can install `pgvector` from repositories, from tarballs and it is also available in Docker image.
* Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) 2.43.2 is now compatible with `pg_stat_monitor` 2.1.0 to monitor PostgreSQL 17.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 and compatible derivatives, Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL also includes the following packages:

* `llvm` 17.0.6 packages. This fixes compatibility issues with LLVM from upstream.
* supplemental `python3-etcd` 0.4.5 packages, which can be used for setting up Patroni clusters. 

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is also shipped with the [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/libpq.html) library. It contains "a set of
library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL
backend server and to receive the results of these queries."
